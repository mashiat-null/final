Set 1:
1. Design a base class called shape . Use this class to store two double type values that 
could be used to compute the area of figures. Derive two specific classes triangle and 
rectangle from the base class shape. Add to the base class a member function getdata() to 
initialize base class members and another member function display area() to gompute and 
display the area of figures
2. Create class called shopping list . The shopping list includes details such as the item 
code number and price of item. Provide operations such as Adding an item to the list 
Deleting an item from the list Printing the total value .

Set 2:
